## ðŸš€ Quick Start
Deploy `tau` in three simple steps:

1. **Install Tau**
   ```sh
   curl https://get.tau.link/tau | sh
   ```

2. **Configure**
   ```sh
   tau config generate -n yourdomain.com -s compute --protos all --ip your_public_ip
   ```

3. **Launch**
   ```sh
   tau start -s compute
   ```

## ðŸ§ª E2E Testing for Your Project

`libdream`, a sub-package within `tau`, is a powerful tool for creating end-to-end (E2E) unit tests for your projects. By simulating real-world cloud behavior in a controlled local environment, libdream enables comprehensive testing scenarios that mimic production environments. This ensures your applications perform reliably under real-world conditions before global deployment.

## ðŸ’¡ Running a Local Cloud

Dreamland ([github.com/taubyte/dreamland](https://github.com/taubyte/dreamland)) is a CLI tool that creates local cloud environments mirroring production settings. It offers an API for real-time configuration and testing, powered by libdream. Dreamland ensures developers can simulate and interact with their applications in a production-like environment, streamlining the path from development to deployment.

## âœ¨ Core Principles of Tau

- **Embracing Best Practices:** `tau` integrates automation with DevOps, GitOps, and SRE best practices, ensuring projects are reliable, efficient, and secure.

- **Elevating Platform Engineering:** For platform engineers, `tau` provides tools and autonomy to customize and perfect the cloud environment, enhancing infrastructure effectively.

- **A Developer-Centric Experience:** `tau` prioritizes developers, ensuring seamless scalability from local development to global production.
